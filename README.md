# Rally Racer 
** by Yvonne Grealy **

This is the README for **Rally Racer**, a car racing game designed using HTML5 Canvas.  The following are game instructions on how to play Rally Racer.

Three laps, two cars and just one winner.  You control the brave red car, cast out by the other cars and looking to redeem itself here on race day.  The evil blue car is your arch-nemisis and driver extraordinaire.

When you're ready to race just press the space bar and you're ready to drive for your life.  You control the red car using the keyboard arrows.  You have to stay on the track, get too close to the barriers and you will crash.  You need to use all your cunning to pass the finish line 3 times before the blue car.

In a game described by some as... 
> Grand

and 

> *That's* your game?

...once you begin to play **Rally Racer** you may not be able to stop.
